## TODO

- Use a logger instead of print()
- Can we auto-detect the website instead of having it as configuration?
- Use command line arguments that can override the config for
  - Website
  - Competition ID
  - Poll frequency
- Use poetry as dependency manager
- Determine time left in competition to cap number of iterations
